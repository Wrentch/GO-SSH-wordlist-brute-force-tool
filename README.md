# GO SSH wordlist brute force tool
### My second mini project in Golang
This is a simple SSH wordlist bruteforce tool I made for fun. It asks you for the address of the targer and its username. Then it will pull the list of words from the wordlist file.
When it finds the right password it will stop the loop and display the password. I already provided the wordlist but you can change it and the port in the code. Might implement custom wordlist and wrong input handling in the future.

TO DO:
Add concurency
